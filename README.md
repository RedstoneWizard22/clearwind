# clearwind

Clearwind is a svelte component library, powered by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It aims to make side development as fast as possible, whilst providing extensive theming options, not being constrained to any given look and feel.

## WIP

Clearwind is still under development, aiming for a v1.0 release by the end of summer 2022.
